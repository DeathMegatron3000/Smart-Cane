# Smart Cane Architecture Design

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for an Arduino-based smart cane with obstacle detection capabilities. The design focuses on simplicity, effectiveness, and low cost, making it accessible for beginners.

## System Components

### Core Components
1. **Arduino Uno** - Main microcontroller
   - Processes sensor data
   - Controls feedback mechanisms
   - Manages power distribution

2. **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** - Obstacle detection
   - Detection range: 2cm to 400cm
   - Accuracy: ~0.3cm
   - Operating voltage: 5V
   - Current consumption: 15mA during operation

3. **Vibration Motor** - Tactile feedback
   - Small coin-type vibration motor
   - Provides haptic feedback when obstacles are detected
   - Low power consumption

4. **Power Supply** - Portable power
   - Options:
     - 9V battery with connector
     - 4xAA battery pack (6V)
     - Rechargeable Li-ion battery pack (with appropriate voltage regulation)

### Additional Components
1. **Push Button** - User control
   - Allows temporary disabling of obstacle detection
   - Can implement single/double press functionality

2. **LED Indicator** - Visual feedback
   - Indicates system status (on/off)
   - Optional battery level indication

3. **Mounting Hardware**
   - Attachment mechanism to standard white cane
   - Protective casing for electronics

## System Architecture

### Functional Blocks
1. **Sensing Block**
   - HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
   - Positioned at the front of the cane
   - Angled slightly downward for optimal detection

2. **Processing Block**
   - Arduino Uno
   - Processes distance measurements
   - Implements detection algorithms
   - Controls feedback intensity based on distance

3. **Feedback Block**
   - Vibration motor for tactile alerts
   - Optional buzzer for audio feedback
   - LED for visual status indication

4. **Control Block**
   - Push button for user interaction
   - Power switch

5. **Power Block**
   - Battery
   - Voltage regulation (if needed)
   - Power distribution

### Data Flow
1. Ultrasonic sensor sends pulses and receives echoes
2. Arduino calculates distance based on echo time
3. If distance is below threshold (e.g., <30cm), activate feedback
4. User can temporarily disable feedback via button press
