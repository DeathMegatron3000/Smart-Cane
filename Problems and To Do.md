# Problems and To Do

## Known Issues

1. **Sensor Accuracy**: The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor may have reduced accuracy in certain environments:
   - Soft or sound-absorbing surfaces may not reflect sound waves properly
   - Very narrow objects might be missed by the sensor
   - Performance may degrade in extreme weather conditions

2. **Battery Life**: The current design prioritizes simplicity over power efficiency:
   - Continuous operation drains the 9V battery relatively quickly
   - No low battery warning mechanism is implemented

3. **Mounting Stability**: The attachment to a standard cane could be improved:
   - Current mounting method may shift during extended use
   - Vibration from walking can affect sensor readings

## Future Improvements

1. **Hardware Enhancements**:
   - Add multiple sensors for wider detection coverage
   - Implement a more efficient power management system
   - Design a custom PCB to replace the breadboard
   - Add LED indicators for system status and battery level

2. **Software Improvements**:
   - Implement variable vibration intensity based on distance
   - Add double-press button functionality for permanent enable/disable
   - Create adaptive threshold adjustment based on environment
   - Implement sleep mode for power conservation

3. **User Experience**:
   - Design a more ergonomic mounting system
   - Add audio feedback option for users who prefer sound alerts
   - Create a mobile app for configuration and customization
   - Develop a rechargeable battery solution

4. **Documentation**:
   - Create video tutorials for assembly and use
   - Translate documentation into multiple languages
   - Add more detailed troubleshooting guides
   - Document real-world testing results and user feedback
