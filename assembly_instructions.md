- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Vibration Motor (small coin type)
- Push Button
- 9V Battery with Battery Holder and ON/OFF switch
- LED (optional, for power indication)

- 10kΩ Resistor (for button pull-up, if not using internal pull-up)
- 2N2222 Transistor (for driving the vibration motor)
- 1N4001 Diode (for motor back-EMF protection)

### Tools and Supplies
- Breadboard (mini or standard size)

## Assembly Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace
1. Find a clean, well-lit workspace with access to a power outlet
2. Organize all components and tools for easy access
3. Have a computer ready with the Arduino IDE installed for programming

### Step 2: Initial Testing of Components
1. **Test the Arduino Uno**:
   - Connect the Arduino to your computer using the USB cable
   - Open the Arduino IDE and upload a simple "Blink" sketch to verify it works
   - If the onboard LED blinks, your Arduino is functioning correctly

2. **Test the HC-SR04 Sensor**:
   - Visually inspect the sensor for any damage
   - The sensor should have 4 pins: VCC, Trig, Echo, and GND

3. **Test the Vibration Motor**:
   - Connect the motor directly to a 3V source (like two AA batteries) momentarily
   - The motor should vibrate when powered

### Step 3: Breadboard Setup
1. Place the breadboard in front of you with the numbered rows horizontal
2. Position the Arduino Uno next to the breadboard for easy access to pins

### Step 4: Connect Power Rails
1. Connect Arduino 5V to the breadboard's positive power rail (usually marked with a red line)
2. Connect Arduino GND to the breadboard's negative power rail (usually marked with a blue line)

### Step 5: Connect the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
1. Place the HC-SR04 sensor on the breadboard, straddling the center gap
2. Connect the sensor pins as follows:
   - VCC pin → Breadboard positive power rail (5V)
   - GND pin → Breadboard negative power rail (GND)
   - Trig pin → Arduino digital pin 2 (using a jumper wire)
   - Echo pin → Arduino digital pin 3 (using a jumper wire)

### Step 6: Connect the Vibration Motor Circuit
*Note: We'll use a transistor to drive the motor since Arduino pins can't provide enough current*

1. Place the 2N2222 transistor on the breadboard with each leg in a different row
   - The transistor has three legs: Collector (C), Base (B), and Emitter (E)
   - Typically, when looking at the flat side, the legs are E, B, C from left to right

2. Connect the transistor:
   - Connect the Base (middle leg) to Arduino digital pin 4 through a 1kΩ resistor
   - Connect the Emitter (left leg when flat side facing you) to the breadboard's negative power rail (GND)
   - The Collector (right leg) will connect to the motor

3. Connect the diode:
   - Place the 1N4001 diode on the breadboard
   - Connect the cathode (end with the stripe) to the positive power rail
   - Connect the anode (end without the stripe) to the transistor's Collector

4. Connect the vibration motor:
   - Connect the positive (+) lead of the motor to the breadboard's positive power rail
   - Connect the negative (-) lead of the motor to the transistor's Collector (same row as the diode anode)

### Step 7: Connect the Push Button
1. Place the push button on the breadboard, straddling the center gap
2. Connect one side of the button to Arduino digital pin 5
3. Connect the other side of the button to the breadboard's negative power rail (GND)
   - *Note: We'll use Arduino's internal pull-up resistor, so no external resistor is needed*

### Step 8: Connect the Power Supply (9V Battery)
1. Ensure the battery holder's switch is in the OFF position
2. Connect the battery holder's positive (+) wire to the Arduino's Vin pin
3. Connect the battery holder's negative (-) wire to the Arduino's GND pin
4. Insert the 9V battery into the holder (but keep the switch OFF for now)

### Step 9: Final Wiring Check
1. Double-check all connections against the circuit diagram
2. Ensure there are no loose wires or accidental short circuits
3. Verify that the battery holder switch is still OFF

### Step 10: Upload the Arduino Code
1. Connect the Arduino to your computer using the USB cable
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the "smart_cane.ino" sketch
3. Select the correct board (Arduino Uno) and port from the Tools menu
4. Click the Upload button to transfer the code to the Arduino
5. Wait for the "Upload complete" message

### Step 11: Initial Testing
1. Keep the Arduino connected to the computer via USB
2. Open the Serial Monitor (set to 9600 baud)
3. You should see the initialization message: "Smart Cane - Obstacle Detection System"
4. Move your hand in front of the ultrasonic sensor at different distances
5. The Serial Monitor should display the measured distances
6. When your hand is closer than 30cm, the vibration motor should activate
7. Press the button to verify that detection can be temporarily disabled/enabled

### Step 12: Battery Power Testing
1. Disconnect the Arduino from the USB cable
2. Turn ON the battery holder's switch
3. The system should now be powered by the battery
4. Repeat the testing from Step 11 to ensure everything works on battery power
5. Turn OFF the battery when finished testing

### Step 13: Mounting to the Cane
1. Find a suitable location on your white cane for mounting the system
   - Typically, the upper portion of the cane works best
   - The ultrasonic sensor should face forward, unobstructed

2. Prepare the mounting:
   - If using a project box: place all components inside the box, with only the sensor exposed
   - If mounting directly: use a small piece of thin plywood or plastic as a base

3. Secure the Arduino and breadboard:
   - Use Velcro strips or double-sided tape to attach them to your mounting base
   - Ensure all connections remain secure during mounting

4. Mount the ultrasonic sensor:
   - Position the sensor facing forward
   - Angle it slightly downward (about 15 degrees) for better obstacle detection

5. Secure the vibration motor:
   - Place the motor where it can be easily felt when holding the cane
   - Typically near the handle or where your hand naturally rests

6. Attach the battery holder:
   - Secure it in an accessible location for easy battery replacement
   - Ensure the switch can be easily reached

7. Use zip ties or Velcro straps to secure the entire assembly to the cane
   - Wrap the straps around the cane and through/around your mounting base
   - Tighten securely but avoid damaging any components

### Step 14: Final Testing and Adjustments
1. Turn ON the power switch
2. Walk slowly with the cane, approaching various obstacles
3. The vibration motor should activate when obstacles are within 30cm
4. Test the button functionality to temporarily disable detection
5. Make adjustments as needed:
   - If the detection is too sensitive, modify the `detectionThreshold` value in the code
   - If the vibration is too weak, consider using a stronger motor or adjusting the circuit

## Troubleshooting

### No Power
- Check that the battery is charged and properly inserted
- Verify the power switch is in the ON position
- Check all power connections for loose wires

### Sensor Not Detecting Obstacles
- Verify the sensor connections (VCC, GND, Trig, Echo)
- Ensure the sensor is not physically damaged
- Check that nothing is blocking the sensor's "eyes"

### Motor Not Vibrating
- Check the motor connections
- Verify the transistor is correctly oriented and connected
- Test the motor directly with a battery to ensure it works

### Button Not Working
- Check the button connections
- Verify the code is correctly reading the button state
- Try using an external pull-up resistor if the internal one isn't working

## Maintenance Tips

1. **Battery Care**:
   - Remove the battery when not in use for extended periods
   - Replace the battery when detection range or vibration strength decreases

2. **Connection Maintenance**:
   - Periodically check all connections for looseness
   - Re-secure any components that may have shifted during use

3. **Sensor Care**:
   - Keep the ultrasonic sensor clean and free from debris
   - Avoid exposing the electronics to water or extreme temperatures

## Conclusion
